        I am Gbenga Adelaja from Nigeria. I started out as a coding enthusiast after backing up as a MAXIMO system admin
        for a Colleague at work. I have since moved from Python to PHP, JAVA at the Back end and then I tried
        Javascript after a reading a brief online. From then, my love for the Front end have grown tremendously.

        I have provided links to my favorite works on this website. As you check through, you'll notice my simple
        lifestyle by my choices.

        I am a lover of football and an eclective reader.

        I'm a Husband, father and an Enthusiast.
