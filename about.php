        I am Gbenga Adelaja from Nigeria. I started out as a coding enthusiast after backing up as a MAXIMO system admin
        for a Colleague at work. I have since moved from Python to PHP, JAVA at the Back end and then I tried
        Javascript after a reading a brief online. From then, my love for the Front end have grown tremendously.<br><br>

        I have provided links to my favorite works on this website. As you check through, You'll notice some of
        the Jobs are still under construction. Also, my choice of colours and designs are for test only and represent
        my choices.
        <br><br>

        I am a lover of football and an eclective reader.<br><br>

        I'm a Husband, father and an Enthusiast.<br><br>

        You can reach me on goadelaja2002@gmail.com and 070345629802      </p>
